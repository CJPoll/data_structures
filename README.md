This project is a personal one, intended to increase my understanding of data
structures and the algorithms that act on them.

The basic idea is to implement each of the common data structures; determine the
worst, average, and best case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and
lookup of values for each; and determine the worst, average, and best case time
complexity for the algorithms that act upon them (particularly sorting
algorithms).

I'll implement each data structure in order:
1. Ruby
1. Objective-C
1. Java
1. Erlang
1. C++

I'll implement each data structure twice in each language,
* Once using standard libraries for the language (Hashes in Ruby, NSDictionary
  in Objective-C, etc.)
* A second time using only language primitives (No libraries)
